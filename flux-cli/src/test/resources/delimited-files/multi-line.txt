ARS,USDA Agricultural Research Service,ARS-INSJ-INSJCME,INSJCME,,"INSJCME is a man made tile fed surface drainage ditch water quality and flow discharge monitoring station located 4.7 km W of Waterloo, IN.  10 minute interval velocity and stage data is collected. Daily and high intensity triggered based watersampling occurs from mid March through mid November. Water samples from this site have been analyzed for acetochlor, alachlor, atrazine, metolachlor, alechlor, glyphosate, simazine, nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus.
