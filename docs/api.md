Flux can be embedded as a normal dependency into your own application. All the functionality available via 
the Flux CLI can instead be accessed via a public API. 

More info will be available soon; please see 
[the JavaDocs](https://special-adventure-5m8egoy.pages.github.io/assets/javadoc) in the meantime.
